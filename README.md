# Spatial Branching Process Model for Epidemic Diffusion
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gerritgr/SpatialBranchingProcess/HEAD?filepath=main.ipynb)

This is an example implementation of "Epidemic Overdispersion Strengthens the Effectiveness of Mobility Restrictions" (Gro√ümann et al.).
See https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348680143_Epidemic_Overdispersion_Strengthens_the_Effectiveness_of_Mobility_Restrictions for more information.
You can simply run all the cells from top to bottom to get the results.

Note that his is PoC-code and not optimized.
Tested with *Julia 1.5.3*.
